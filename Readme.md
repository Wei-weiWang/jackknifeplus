# Introduction

Jackknife+ is a conformal prediction method to construct prediction intervals without distributional or algorithmic assumptions. Here, we only assume the training/testing data to be i.i.d. and the algorithm to be invariant to permutation of the training set. In this package, we assume the algorithm as linear regression. Jackknife+ constructs the prediction interval based on the sample quantile of leave-one-out (LOO) residuals. It enjoys a theoretical coverage of 1-2α.

In this package, several conformal prediction algorithms, including Jackknife+, Jackknife, Jackknife-mm, and K-fold cross-validation are implemented. The conformal prediction algorithms take the training dataset as input and produces a function mapping the test data to its prediction interval. 


## Installation instructions

Use git clone : download this package from github to local.

## Functions

We have four main R functions: jackknifeplus_c_wrapper, jackknife_c_wrapper, jackknifeplusMM_c_wrapper and jackknifeplusCV_c_wrapper which are to calculate prediction intervals by four different methods respectively: Jackknife+, Jackknife, Jackknife-mm, and K-fold cross-validation . Actually, we use C code inside to make them faster because these algorithms need to calculate loops. 

### Jackknife+ interval

$$\hat{C}_{n,a}^{jackknife+} = [\hat{q}^{-}_{n,a}\{\hat{\mu}_{-i}(X_{n+1})-R_i^{LOO}\}, \hat{q}^{+}_{n,a}\{\hat{\mu}_{-i}(X_{n+1})+R_i^{LOO}\}]$$
