Description: Jackknifeplus is a conformal prediction method to construct prediction intervals without distributional or algorithmic assumptions. It constructs the prediction interval based on the sample quantile of leave oneo out (LOO) residuals. It enjoys a theoretical coverage of 1-2a. This package will create Jackknifeplus prediction intervals.
